1) Figure out discrepancy between mine and Borisova's NBrS in LAr results. Borisova's XS data and energy step size.
2) Npe x-y experiment vs theory distribution 
3) (In code) Multiple THGEM mappings and single field map implementation is a little wonky at the moment: GlobalData behavior (loading field map) is dependent on selected detector type explicitly in the code. Also, when calculating electric field at global point, dummy HexagonalMapping class is created.
4) Proper logging in python scripts (separate log for meshing, field calculations and geant4 simulation as well as python's script itself)
