1) Replace bash RunsSimulation scripts with python. Because the latter is cleaner, more stable and much more readable and sane.
2) RunSimulation scripts in the same manner for both v10 (final version of old detector (220203 and 220804)) and new v11 (oct. 2022).
3) Calculate and plot Npe vs electron drift step with diffusion for couple of THGEM voltages. Needed for optimal step size and correct results with diffusion.
4) Figure out discrepancy between mine and Borisova's NBrS in LAr results. Borisova's XS data and energy step size.
5) Npe x-y experiment vs theory distribution 
6) (In code) Multiple THGEM mappings and single field map implementation is a little wonky at the moment: GlobalData behavior (loading field map) is dependent on selected detector type explicitly in the code. Also, when calculating electric field at global point, dummy HexagonalMapping class is created.
