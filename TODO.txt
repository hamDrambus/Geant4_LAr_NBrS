// QoL or coding issues:
1) (In code) Multiple THGEM mappings and single field map implementation is a little bit wonky at the moment: GlobalData behavior (loading field map) is dependent on selected detector type explicitly in the code. Also, when calculating electric field at global point, dummy HexagonalMapping class is created.
2) Proper logging in python scripts (separate log for meshing, field calculations and geant4 simulation as well as python's script itself)
3) .py all testing
4) Create install_all.py for full project set-up: dependency installation, environment set-up and build.
So that [load the code]->[run install_all.py]->[run results/*/RunSimulation.py]->[analyze results] can be done without thinking/remembering what is happening at all. Although CMake does make compilation or Eclipse set-up quite simple at the moment.
5) Fix bug in Garfield++ ComponentElmer::ElectricField(x,y,z,ex,ey,ez,m,status) (most likely in ComponentFieldMap::MapCoordinates or less likely in ComponentFieldMap::FindElement13's conditions) which results in inconsistent fields at the edge of THGEM cell. Ask for pull request as well. UPD: fixed by using optimized mesh. Had to switch to Gmsh v4 for that.
